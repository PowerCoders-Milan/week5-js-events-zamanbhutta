# Counting

Create two buttons, when clicked they will increment or decrease the counter in the p tag.

Once it reaches +10 or -10 show an image below the counter.

You can either create an image element or hide/show an existing image.

# Extra

Position the "+1" button to the right and the "-1" to the left.

The counter will start at the center of the screen and move towards the button that you clicked.

Enjoy!
