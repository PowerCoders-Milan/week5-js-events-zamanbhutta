# Screensize

Write a JavaScript program to get the width and height of the window (any time the window is resized).

Then write the sizes in the p element in a nice format ("The window is x pixels" or similar).

# Extra

Change the color of the screen based on 3 sizes of your choice (ex. 300px green, 500px black , 700+ yellow)
